# Hornazos por el mundo
***Hornazos por el mundo*** (Hornazo is a typical spanish patty, so the name is ***Patties by the world***) We want to create a small blog with recipes and typical dishes of our trips.
For it, we are going to use Jekyll and we will explain how to set up a blog with jenkyll in this *README*.
- ### Install jekyll
        gem install bundler jekyll
- ### Generate jekyll files
        jekyll new . --force
